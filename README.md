# Capstone Planning

#### by Krystal Foster

## Name of Project: Blog Engine

### Projectâ€™s Purpose or Goal:

A React CRUD app that allows a selection of authenticated users to update and curate community blog posts. May evolve into a musical or creative-leaning forum after MVP is hit but I am focused on making a functioning blog for now that I can specialize in the coming weeks. I plan to incorporate both firebase and redux, user authentication, rich text editing tools, site routing, the ability for users to edit/delete/upload their own posts, and comment on others. My end goal is to open a space that facilitates interaction between like-minded users.    

### List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

* Working firebase database that stores and pushes blog entries to DOM
* the ability for authorized users to add, edit and delete blog entries.
* User authentication with the correct authorized views and control over their own posts.
* routing throughout, including log in page, blog entry form, about page, home, etc.
* user dashboard with convenient links to their past posts for review and editing purposes.
* Master blog list limited to so many characters, with the full post visible on click.
* Rich text editor feature that preserves whitespace and text formatting for bloggers.

## NOTE: Clicking the "home" link routes you to the "postlist" portion of this project which works and is currently informed by a firebase database, but the api key is needed to run it. Ultimately I will deploy it to firebase publicly, in the meantime, feel free to ask me for my config file and credentials or to make your own.

### What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

* React/jsx
* JavaScript
* Firebase data and auth
* possibly draft.js or another framework to allow rich text editing

### If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

* Admin component with the ability to monitor and edit all community posts
* Search component
* multi-page routing after every 10 posts and better site organization
* Blog calendar and archive component  
* subtle animations, styles, extra stuff to make the site more immersive.
* further down the road I would like to teach myself socketing or how to incorporate chat rooms. This project is basically my first step into building a social site.
